# ChessProject
Welcome to my Chess project written with Python for my fundamentals of Python course. This is a simplified version of a game of chess. The chessboard is the same with 8 rows, however, this time each player has 1 king, 1 bishop, 2 rooks, and a 2 knights.

## How to Play
Two users will take turns controlling their piece colors:

1. First user will choose a piece by their coordinates such as, a2 or b2, etc.
    - Rules of regular chess continues to apply with pieces for this game
2. Next the same user will input the desired location again using coordinates.
3. King cannot be checked by the opponent
4. First to reach row 8 with their king wins!

Have fun!
